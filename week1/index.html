	<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kevin. For the sake of simplicity, I'll just repeat here what I said in the class introductions. I was a professional-philosopher-in-training until personal circumstances closed the doors on opportunities for research in my specialization. I made a switch to web development since I had previous exposure to it and programming languages speak to my love of formal logic.</p>
    <h2>Some things I do for fun</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Play video games</li>
        <li>Weightlift</li>
        <li>Watch anime</li>
    </ul>
